[{"pk":1,"model":"projects.project","fields":{"name":"Wales","description":"This was followed by over seven hundred years of subjugation, exploitation, and discrimination. This has left long lasting effects on our culture, landscape, and national psyche. We see ourselves as underdogs, separate, less than. Although pushed to the western edges of the UK, Ireland and France, a small Celtic speaking minority has remained along the fringes of the continent. It is in one of these areas, known as ‘Y Fro Gymraeg’, where my project takes place. Here, Welsh is still spoken, and Welsh traditions, myths and culture remain a part of everyday life. West Wales, where I am from, and where a large part of this project was photographed is not only the poorest area in the UK, but the whole of Northern Europe. It is a hard life here, but for some, the quiet, community orientated and relatively affordable existence has been enough. Sadly, this way of life is dwindling each year. Our rugged mountains and coastline have long protected and retained our language, culture, and sense of heritage, but sadly, these features of beauty have now come to be our curse. Holiday homes are on the rise here at unprecedented rates. Towns and villages up and down the Welsh Coast now lay half empty for most of the year, while local people want for houses. With few jobs in this area, people in my community are others like mine work in fields such care, construction, services, or tourism, with no choice but to cater for the needs of these new, wealthier incomers from across the border. Each year, in the struggle to keep our heads above water, we lose a little more of who we are. Each year houses become more unattainable, more and more holiday homes creep into our communities, more darkened windows, more empty seats at the bar and in our community halls, and even renting is becoming more difficult as more and more houses are being turned into short term holiday lets. And each year we have to make do with less and less. This body of work is an effort to convey the sense of loss and hopelessness we feel. A lament or elegy if you will, for what once was, could have been, or maybe even what we never had in the first place. My people and this land bear the heavy weight of our past, and now we also bear the weight of a bleak and uncertain future. Together we are a land and people defined by the oppression of our larger neighbour, now forced to live in its shadow. While this project is about my small part of Wales, the work is also acts as an allegory for many other working class and minority communities from across the UK and the greater world. I believe the weight felt in this work, of imperialism and gentrification affecting culture and communities, is an often-overlooked issue that would benefit from greater acknowledgement, publication, and discourse."}},{"pk":2,"model":"projects.project","fields":{"name":"Discovery","description":""}}]
